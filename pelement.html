  <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be
  distracted by the readable content of a page when 
  looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum 
  is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, 
  as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', 
  making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing 
  packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default
  model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web
  sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over 
  the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
